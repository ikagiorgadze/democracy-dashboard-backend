## Severity
- `BLOCKER`: Critical flaw that exposes security/data risk or breaks core functionality; must be fixed before release.
- `HIGH`: Major issue affecting correctness, security posture, or core reliability; prioritize immediately after blockers.
- `MEDIUM`: Important improvement that reduces operational risk or tech debt but can follow higher-severity fixes.
- `LOW`: Nice-to-have or minor cleanup; schedule after higher priorities.

## Type
- `security`: Tasks that close vulnerabilities or harden the surface area.
- `architecture`: Structural changes that improve layering, validation, or cross-cutting concerns.
- `bug`: Defects causing incorrect behavior, crashes, or inconsistent responses.
- `reliability`: Work that increases availability, resilience, or configuration safety.
- `performance`: Changes focused on latency, throughput, or resource usage.
- `testing`: Test coverage, tooling, and automation.
- `docs`: Documentation updates or knowledge gaps.
- `dx`: Developer experience improvements (tooling, scripts, workflows).
